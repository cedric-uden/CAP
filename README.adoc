= Church Audio Podcast

This app periodically verifies the church's YT channel for new sermons.

When available, the URL is sent to a MP3 converter to get the audio file.

Said audio file is then transferred onto an FTP server where it is then processed
and finalised by the team in the church's office.

== Structure

=== YT watchdog

Works via YouTube API and checks if any new videos have been uploaded.

=== YT to MP3 downloader

Works on the server which then proceeds to download sermons to mp3 based on
their ID.

```
brew install youtube-dl
youtube-dl --extract-audio --audio-format mp3 <video-id>
```

=== Upload to FTP

WIP: will upload the MP3 to an FTP server

== Setup

```
conda create --name cap python=3.9
conda activate cap
conda install poetry
poetry install
```
